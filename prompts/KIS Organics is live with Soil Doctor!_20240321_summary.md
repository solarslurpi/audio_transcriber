# Knowledge Document: KIS Organics is live with Soil Doctor! March 21, 2024

## Introduction

The speakers in this transcript are Mason, a farmer and consultant, and Bryant, the host. Mason has extensive experience in organic farming and consulting.

This transcript covers a wide range of topics related to organic growing practices, including soil management, nutrient cycling, fertilizers, and sustainable agriculture. The discussion provides valuable insights and practical advice based on the speakers' personal experiences and scientific knowledge.

## Raised Bed Construction

- For safe and affordable raised bed construction, Mason recommends using untreated cedar or redwood lumber. Specifically, he states:

> "I would get rough cut, two by six cedar. And that's what I would make the beds out of with four by four posts in the corners."

- Alternatives like treated lumber, cinder blocks, or plywood are not recommended due to potential contamination or aesthetic concerns.
- Bryant is experimenting with charring and oiling inexpensive pine lumber from Home Depot to extend its lifespan.

## Organic Amendments and Fertilizers

### Coffee Grounds
- Both speakers are open to using coffee grounds as an organic amendment, as they contain nitrogen and can be a good way to recycle waste.
- Moderation is advised, as excessive quantities may lead to nitrogen imbalances.
- Bryant notes: "I think they're great. I mean, I've always applied them just to my compost pile or my worm bin."

### Hydrofiber
- Hydrofiber is discussed as a potential replacement for perlite or peat moss, but neither speaker has extensive experience with it.
- It may have different properties than peat moss and require adjustment in fertilizer application rates.

### Oyster Shell Flour
- Oyster shell flour is a mined product that can provide calcium to the soil.
- Its availability to plants depends on factors like soil pH, microbial activity, temperature, and moisture.
- Typically, it takes around 7-14 days for plants to show a response when conditions are favorable for microbial activity.
- Discussing oyster shell flour availability, Mason mentions: "I want to guess like a 342 range. It was kind of a pretty balanced one from what I remember."

### Humic Acids
- Humic acids are used as a soluble carbon input and to help chelate micronutrients.
- Long-term effects of high humic acid use in living soil are not well understood by the speakers.

### Pit Moss
- Pit Moss is a cardboard byproduct being explored as a potential peat moss replacement.
- It has different properties than peat moss, with a higher pH and water-holding capacity.
- Bryant has not yet cracked the code for using it as a full peat moss replacement in his growing system.

## Nutrient Cycling and Microbial Activity

- Temperature, moisture, and oxygen levels are the primary drivers of nutrient cycling in the soil.
- Fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratios can fluctuate based on environmental conditions and may not be the best indicator of soil health.
- Microbial diversity and abundance are supported by continually introducing carbon sources through organic amendments and cover crops.
- Excessive drying can reduce microbial activity, but microbes can persist in microfilms of water and quickly rebound when moisture is reintroduced.
- The impact of conventional fertilizers on microbial populations is debated, with potential effects dependent on factors like salt index, application rates, and long-term carbon inputs.

## Tissue vs. Sap Testing

- Mason recommends starting with tissue testing for nutrient management, as it provides a higher return on investment and is easier to interpret than sap testing.
- Sap testing can be valuable for large commercial growers aiming to optimize nitrogen management but requires frequent testing and a deeper commitment.
- In Mason's experience, sap testing did not provide additional benefits over tissue testing despite the higher cost. He states:

> "I've gotten nothing additional from the probably $1,000 I've spent sap testing. Then I've gotten from tissue testing. Nothing. And I've spent $200 tissue testing. And I've gotten no conclusions that have been better than my tissue results."

## Best Carbon Sources for Small Growers

- Organic growers are already introducing significant carbon through amendments like alfalfa meal, bone meal, kelp meal, and compost.
- Additional carbon can come from slow-release sources like mulch, wood chips (with caution), or fast-release sources like liquid fish, amino acids, teas, and ferments.
- Plants themselves contribute a substantial amount of carbon to the soil through root exudates.
