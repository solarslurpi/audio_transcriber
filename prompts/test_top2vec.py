 All right, welcome back everybody to another fun and tantalizing Tuesday. I always like to match words, but another Tuesday organic Q&A with Ted and Chad. How you doing today, Ted? I'm good, man. I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing pretty freaking awesome. You know, thanks everybody for showing up in chat. I see you all here already. Definitely get your questions in. I will be keeping my eye on them during this show. And I'll kind of star them and try to bring them in as we can. But again, this show is generated by you guys. That's what we are here for. We are here to answer your questions pertaining to organic gardening. And before some of the questions, let's get into what we're up to. What are you up to lately, Tab? What's what's coming up on your future horizons? Yeah, so right now I am cramming for the, I think they're calling it the Soil Summit or the Living Soil Summit. Grassroots Pots is hosting it at, and it's going to be at Steve Cantwell's location in Perump, Nevada. I'm actually flying out tomorrow for that. There's going to be a whole bunch of people talk in organic soil and things there. It's really excited for it. I'm giving a talk or Kiss Organics has a two-hour block of speaking and we're going to be talking about like I'm going to go over like six years of podcast sort of like the highlights and things around that and then I'm also doing a talk on the safety and efficacy of like bone meal and blood meal and feather meal and those sorts of things because there's been some stuff generated around whether you know are these products safe? Are we contaminating our crop by using bone meal or blood meal or feather meal? Are we getting antibiotics and GMOs and we could be using really safe ocean products like fish and fish bone and this message is really perpetuating and so I wanted to get some actual science and research on this topic around this idea of just critically thinking about what we hear online whether that's from you know an influencer or a scientist or just about anybody. How do we really look at this and know what to think of it? Yeah, critical thinking is so important. And I know you're about to give the speech at the upcoming summit. So I won't get too far into it. But I hope this is a subject that we could talk about in the future because I live right next to the ocean and this town is run on seafood. So I have unlimited access to like shells, fish guts, like cowp, you name it, but I have my concerns with ocean products. So maybe we could get into that on a future episode. I'll give you the short answer now and I plan on actually taking our talks and making them into making them into YouTube presentations. So I'll share that information online here for at least the sections that we do. But yeah, the short answer is no product is perfect. Even alfalfa meal or Neme cake or insect frats. Well, insect frats is by far my favorite, I will say, in terms of sustainability and safety and everything all around. But beyond that, everything has some level of an issue with it. And the meat-based products from the slaughterhouse industry, our meat industry, are actually a lot cleaner than people realize based on the research that exists. That's all I'm going to say on that for now. Cliffhanger. All right, I will be tuning into that and that's cool. You'll make your speech portions available. And I just want to let everybody know too. Today we are simulcasting as we will every week on the Chad Westport YouTube channel as well as Kiss Organics YouTube channel. And if you're not subscribed to one or the other, they're both down in the notes. But I do want to let you guys know regardless of what channel you're watching on, as long as you enter in the YouTube, we will see the comments. So if you have questions, get them in there. Chat, can you also share what you have going on? I'm to ask you that before you get too far into the thing thing thing thing thing  you. I'm getting ready to do a little more travel. I like to go to the Netherlands every April, coincidentally for 420, which nobody cares about over there. 420 is not a thing, but Kings Day is usually the last week of April and Kingsday is a riot. So we try to make it there for that. Experiencing a lot of the finer things as far as cannabis and hash goes. But as we take the train around the countryside, the Dutch, you know, they're infamous for their greenhouses and their food and crop production and it's so cool to just see what seems like miles of greenhouse after greenhouse after greenhouse and they've got a really cool thing going on as far as like food distribution and amazing to me that that small of a country is actually I think like the number two producer of like, oh gosh, I don't know, like vegetables or something, it's, I probably should have got my facts right, but they produce a whole lot. They're number two as far as production goes in that area. And yeah, given the size, that's amazing. That's fun for me. For other people though, what I have coming up is a new seed drop. That will be April 2nd. I'm not doing it April 1st because nobody takes a serious on April 1st. I didn't even think about that. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. So April 2nd I will be releasing the Westport Posse, which is the S1 of the Westport grape juice. That's kind of like my signature strain. This is the first time I made S-1s of it. And still, still working on some special bonuses for that. So people stay tuned to that. But I always feel a little weird talking about myself. You want to get into some of these awesome questions we have? Yeah, just real quick though, I don't know a lot about your cultivar. Can you just give me the 30- the 30 the 30 the 30 the 30 the 30  yeah, thank you. So it checks all of the boxes as far as like commercial viability, meaning it produces, but it also has the ease for like home growers of not being a very complicated plant. One of my goals with breeding in general is to make short squat plants that have big colas and of course a lot of trichomes and potency. But I'm really aiming towards tent growers. Okay. Big wild sativas are awesome, great for outdoors, but hard to do in a tent. So again, I focus primarily on like home and tent growers and so that's what I'm breeding for. And they finish in 60 days, that's another thing. 60 days or less means you can have six harvests and perpetual system per year. So that's what I'm going for and the Westport Grape Juice checks all of those boxes. Nice, very cool. And you like the effect of it? Yeah, it's something that I usually reserve for kind of like nighttime. It's more of like a contemplative relaxing type effect versus something that makes me want to you know run all my errands for the day but I also have you know I've kind of been drawn to cannabis through my stomach and it really helps with some of the stomach issues that I experience so yeah yeah nice tastes good so kind of a mix mix of body and head effects. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a full body thing. There really isn't a delineation between the onset and the body of the effect. It really just kind of comes on equally, you know, instantly just kind of, you know, slowing the pace of the day down for a moment, you know, but still leaving me clear-headed to take advantage of those clearer thoughts. Nice, that's awesome. I don't have a great endocyananoid system to where like, things, I don't, I don't notice a huge difference, but I have had a few cultivars where I'll be like, okay, that really just hits my head or I really feel this one more in my body. But beyond that, I don't have the ability to really get the nuances out. I'm not a connoisseur. Right. Unfortunately, that's not my thing. I have, my brother is, and my dad, but it just hits me differently. But I can absolutely understand how when people describe their plants, you know, they have these different effects. I think it's pretty interesting and cool. Thanks. And that, you know, it does help me just kind of be in the connoisseur. But one thing that isn't to my advantage is my sense of smell. My sense of smell isn't that great. But at the same time, when I find something in the tent that I'm going through, and it smells to me, that means it really smells. So, kind of the, turn the negative into the positive there. Yeah, I just grew a gorilla number four. And that that that that that plant is that plant is that plant is that plant is that plant is that plant is that plant into the positive there Yeah, I just grew a gorilla number four and that plant is loud. Oh my gosh my my neighbors and my neighbors are not like right next to where it's not like a cookie cutter neighborhood like we have some land they're under 200 feet away and they could smell my garage it was so strong like I actually had to go on by a carbon filter after that run because I'm like I can't have this through the summer when my kids' friends are coming over and things but yeah it was it was one of the last louder plants I've ever grown. It was a lot of fun. Yeah I have you like yesterday. Let's dive into questions. Yeah we can keep doing this. what do we got so far? Are there questions? I've started a couple questions in here already and I want to start because the one, I don't know if you can see the start questions too. The second one from C is kind of getting on another topic. Okay. And then Jay will get into Jay in a second. Yeah, I can answer Jay's question anytime you're ready. Okay, but let me, yeah, let me just put it up then. Let me pop that up for Jay. Okay, so Jay must be Canada. Because Black Swallow is a Canadian company makes, there's kind of like what Oryanx does here in the United States. We sell amendments, we make soils, and I worked with Black Swallow for a couple years in creating this formulation that they call the Kiss soil mix up there. And the short answer is maybe. I know people that will start seeds in what we call living soil or water only soils, but to me that's not optimal. Because really your seed has all nutrients it needs in it already. We want to start, it wants to start in a soil that has greater aeration and ferocity, one that's going to drain better so we can water it more frequently, have more frequent water events to get more oxygen down into the media. And it wants low fertility. So this isn't just for the black swallowchus mix, but for any of these living soils, even like the soils that we make like our biotcharged soil and things like that. Really, they're more created, formulated for established, you know, well-rooted clones or even that next transplant state after the rooted clone has, you know, rooted in actual media too. That's when I really like to go into a high fertility mix, sort of that second transplant in veg. So ideally I'd go, if in a perfect world, which we don't always have, I'd go like seed starter, veg mix, and then, you know, your full-on, full strength, you know, our biochar soil or a kis mix or some other super soil that, you know, you may make yourself or find from another company. And then that's, you know, something that I've heard with other soils that I've th th th th th th th th that you may make yourself or find from another company. And that's something that I've heard with other soils that I've tried to and yeah I usually like to push the envelope on things tell me I can't do something I'm gonna try it. And there have been instances where it's been too hot but then again other times with the same soil, it's been fine. So, you know, what about taking like a little bit of soil? Let's say, you know, your root zone didn't fully fill out the pot previously and there's some extra loose soil. Would it almost make sense starting a seed in a little like cup of that because it has less of a charge or are you worried just about in balance in that soil? Sorry I was thinking about root hairs and hair death and I got a little sidetrack. Could you say that one more time and I'm gonna. No worries. Because what I've done in the past is as I'm emptying my last harvest and I have all of that soil there's's a lot of still loose, good, non-route-infested soil. And I have taken that, put that in small containers, and then started my seed in that before knowing that it was going to have less of a load. Okay, so like depleted soil sort of the end of a cycle, yeah. Yes and no. So yes in the sense that that slow would be lower fertility and I think that could be good. No in the sense that it may not have the optimal and you know gas exchange ratios in terms of porosity narration like many people are familiar with like pro-mix. You know where it has a lot of purline in, it's going to drain rapidly. That's sort of what like a seed starter mix would be, is that similar type of mixed. Also, I go back and forth on this, because on one hand, you might have some really good established like beneficial microorganisms in there that we're living off the last plant. But on the other hand, you also have a higher risk for pet and pathogens. There's more chance that there's going to be something like thusarium in there or you'd have issues with daping off. Because, like, in a traditional horticultural greenhouse, there's no chance they would ever reuse the media like that. Right. Homegrown, probably. But those are just the risks to be thinking about when you're doing it like could be great, could be bad, you know, there's no perfect answer to that I guess, but well you frame it too. Framing it is so important too and that's again something that I forget and sometimes take for granted is I'm focused on home grows, you know, smaller maybe just room grows, whereas you're used to, you know, both, but your world is primarily commercial, larger. And yeah, commercially, I would, I would slap myself for saying something like that. But at the home level, you know, sometimes it makes sense, sometimes the resources are different, but I'm glad that you illustrated the points that people should be aware of the potential pitfalls of doing something like that. But a lot of times, and this is another topic we could get into in another week, is just kind of the differences again between some of the common practices between home gardening and larger scale gardening, because there's there's tricks to both but they don't always translate. So yeah and your your question this is a little bit of a tangent but it's what I've been thinking about today and I think you'll find this a little bit interesting but I so I put up a post on Instagram today about an interview I did with a good friend of mine, a botany professor, non-martial. And one of the things he talks about is, and this relates to the seedling question here in a minute, but when you underwater your plants, you're causing drought stress and you're killing root hairs. So you have this, you have your root and then you have these little tiny hairs that are just one cell thick. And that's where the plant the plant the plant the plant, water uptake occurs in these root hairs. And so when you have droughts, you're killing those root hairs, and the plant will, the plant will suffer. So you'll see, you know, maybe you'll see yellowing up top, you'll see marginal leaf necrosis, that dying of the leaf on the edge of the leaf. But if you, but if you overwater your plant instead of unwatering now, you may see similar symptoms above ground. So your above ground biomass may look, you might start yellowing, you might get the same sort of, you know, marginal leaf necrosis. And that's because you're also getting root hair death when you overwater. So overwatering actually causes drought stress, which is crazy to think about it because you always thought, oh, I'm drowning the plant, but that's not what you're doing. You're killing these root hairs. And where it relates to the seed starter thing is when you have soil that has a lot of nutrients in it, so higher E.C. higher salt content, that puts, that can also cause osmotic pressure on the root hairs and also call, so over fertilization can cause similar above ground symptoms and root hair death as well. And when the soil dries out because of, um it has a lot of nutrients in it, you're more likely to get higher concentrations of these salts. So higher osmotic pressure on the roots, and you have a new plant in a soil that is high fertility soil, you know, these seedlings. Those roots are a lot more sensitive, the plants a lot more sensitive to these changes. It's much harder to water it, and that's where you see those issues. So it's kind of interesting what's the mechanism behind why seeds don't like these high fertility soils. It really all relates to the EC of the solution, the fertility of the solution as it dried out and you're watering. And then also gas exchange. So we want more frequent waterings to occur, which is why you don't want to put a little seedling in a giant 30-gallon pot, ideally, because we want more gas exchange, more oxygen exchange when we water that pushes oxygen down into the soil. And so when you think about it from a bonding perspective, it's actually really pretty fascinating. So I know that was a bit of a tangent, but that was what was on my mind today, and I've been thinking a lot about it. So I wanted to share it. It was a good one, because the, you mentioned compaction. Well, not compaction, compaction is where my head when you talked about gas exchange originally using that soil over again for the seedling because we probably do want more it to be more porous because that compacted soil would kind of make it harder to really branch out and get those fine root hairs which are so important at the beginning stage of, you know, the seedling of the life. So that makes sense and I did see a comment in here too, you know that they reuse their soil all the time and they amend and that's a common practice. That's something that you do, that's something you encourage, you teach people how to do that. Yeah. This was just in a one-off example in my case of trying to, you know, let me grab a little bit of soil. I'm out of soil and I need to start these seedlings. I'll just take some from here. Something like that is, what's the example that we were given? Yeah, and maybe you throw a handful of pearlite in there, pumice or lava rock or something, they'll just lighten it up a little bit and give you more poor space in there. But. But th. But th. But  certain pathogens like Pythium, for example, once the plant gets to a certain size, it's not going to be that as susceptible to it. So when we're talking about reusing soil, certain pathogens like Pythium are going to really damage young plants. Once they get a little bit further in that veg cycle, they're going to be much more resistant to some of these pathogens. So reusing soil a little later down the road may be different than reusing soil early on in the plant's life. Just another consideration for people to think about. All right. And two, you know, because we've been hearing sometimes, and this is mainly the salt regimens, but dry. And, and to, you know, because we've been hearing sometimes, and this is mainly the salt regimens, but dryback. We've been hearing about that. With dryback in organics isn't exactly the most, it's not preferred because you need that moisture to keep the microbial life happy. Everything in the soil just kind of functioning, dryback will kill certain populations of them, that can create an imbalance. When it comes to these drybacks in the solid-fed systems, are they like getting to the point of root hair death usually or do they let it kind of go a little bit past that? How does that interplay with the dryback that we always hear about? Or have you explained with that? Honestly, I have not looked a lot in this salt growing, so I'm not an expert there. What you said about organics and sort of maintaining microbial activity and nutrient cycling is through, you know, more even moisture is really where my head goes. But as I understand it, you know, when we have root hair, we're not losing all the root hairs, and when we have nutrient in ionic forms that we're putting in through salts, those nutrients are going to be taken up pretty readily through the plant. And so my, my thought would be, and again, this is just me off top of my head, would be that these drybacks do create a certain level of stress in the plant, but we don't know what targeted stress responses are beneficial in terms of creating, you know, more trichone production or creating, you know, different cannoid responses. So, I don't know that I have an answer to that, but I think it's something that we're still learning a lot about as an industry in terms of what types of stress responses may be beneficial and may not be. And it's going to vary by cultivar, it's going to vary by environment. There's so many variables here that we may never, we may never really know, but it's interesting. And I mean, that's fair too. We do have the word organics in the title of the show. So, I did want to bring that up though, because it's, you know, it's something that we hear about. I understand it in a rough sense, but the detailed mechanics underneath the soil, yeah, it's something that is probably, somebody out there I'm sure has the information or they're looking into it. A lot of R&D these days. There's a lot, I don't know. I'm always learning new things. So yeah, please, fair enough, don't, I'm gonna say I don't know a lot probably in these things because you guys ask some great questions on here, your audience doesn't so it's all fun. And hopefully they appreciate that. Like I appreciate that too and that's something that I always strive for myself. It's like I don't want to mislead or like just BS somebody. Usually in those cases I'm like, I don't necessarily know here's maybe what I would search for or where I would look because that's always helpful. You know we can typically get people pointed in the right direction even if we don't have the specific answer ourselves and Fonzi Garden guys is what subject base are we using today? Are you guys keeping to a specific area? Um, because that's kind of where we went wrong last time. We had questions out of left field. Kind of sticking with the soil and so maybe some pH-based stuff today. But excellent question, I appreciate you bring that up on the garden guy. And to let people maybe get questions in on that, I'll jump to something completely different right now. Yeah, people want to talk about how to build your own soil. I think that's something that I feel like I could maybe talk about because I have been formulating soils for a long time now, at least for what we call soils, but really piling soil for growing cannabis. I think that's a fun topic. Yeah. Thank you for answering that, because I'll get a little scatterbrain sometimes. But that's, okay, that's the duality here. We're a good team. So this one, Gateway to the Garden had they had put in some questions on the last episode. So I want to definitely make sure to get their to to to to to  one may be kind of fun because it's, you know, could go a variety of different directions. You can get creative with that if you want. But the question is, to both of us is if you lived in a rural area and had to build 200 gallons of soil for outdoors and you had a budget of $30 for free and paid items, how would you go about that? That's not a big budget. Yeah, it's not. So you need a yard of soil, which is a lot, that's a lot of soil. You can't get a yard of cheap top soil for that price, even at your local garden center. And that stuff's crap. You wouldn't be able to grow it anyway. Let's assume he has the soil though, or they have the soil already. What would you do to maybe work on that soil as far as like amendments here? So for me, yeah so the first thing I want to do when I get to like a new property is I want to get a soil test and I want to get a water test because that really tells me my baseline for where I'm starting and fortunately that's already over budget though for what we're talking about here because the soil test to run you about 60 bucks and a water test will run you about $25, $30. Now you could cheat, get a little bit from your municipal water supply if you're not on well water to get a rough idea, but those tests aren't going to tell you from like a cultivation perspective. It's going to tell you if it's safe for you to drink it. So, you know, I could think $30 worth of like fertilizers that are kind of useful. Like maybe I'd spend that on a bag of gypsum, for example, because I know I'm probably going to want to raise calcium. But at this, you're probably growing whatever soil you have on site there. And the two things you're probably going to need to add three, let's say, calcium, nitrogen, and potassium. Because you probably can't even afford to add much phosphorus unless you can get some manures locally to you. But you're really giving up a lot of precision. You're really kind of just going to go for it and guess at a kind of a budget level, unfortunately. But I'd still absolutely try. Find out if your neighbors are growing plant, how well that your native soil does. Because really that's what you're looking at growing. And at that point, I can't grow in my native soil here because the heavy metals are through the roof from the Tacoma smelter. Like, my arms are way too high. So I have to grow all my crops in putting soil and I have to put beds and it's a whole pain in the ass, but it's just the reality of where I live. Well that's scary. I mean anybody in the Washington area, you always know the aroma of Tacoma when you drive through. But the fallout. It's gone now. It's gone in a little bit. The paper's gone. Yeah. Yeah. The fallout from that, that's something I never considered because it's not like you're sitting next to the Tacoma dome. You know, you're not in the middle. It extends quite a way. So there's actually a super fun site in Rustin. It's Rustin, if you know that is in Tacoma. But yeah, you can go on the, I think it's the EPA map or it's a government website and you can actually see where, what the approximate PPM of arsenic is from this smelter in our area and extend to like federal way Des Moines, it goes a little way south and then it comes across the water to like Vashon and where I'm at on Fox Island, Gig Harbor. So yeah, it's always good to know what super fun sites are around where you live from a heavy metal perspective but kind of getting off top here from the question. Right, right, yeah, no super fun sites again, those are the ones that are so extremely bad the government pays extra money to really clean it up. But before we go back to the subject because you just kind of blew my minds. Was it the EPA website that you went to and checked this? Or how did you find your information? So other people, like somebody living in Nebraska, where would they go or what would they do to find that? Yeah, let me see if I could find it for you guys while we're chatting here. Cool, okay. And to the question of, you know, what would you do if you had $30 to work with, you said purchased and free materials. If you're in a rural area, talk with some of the other, you know, your neighbors. Maybe there is a farm down the street that has like a wonderful compost or manure or some waste product that you can actually use and turn into a good product for what you want to do in your crop and in your soil. There's a lot of, and again, I just scratched the surface of these, but like Jodom, K&F methods, you can find out the suitability of some of the native plants and weeds around you, what they have, maybe use fermentation processes, maybe get a couple barrels, or I don't even know if you get a barrel for 30 bucks. But you get to point, you could get a five-gallon bucket, and you can work on some of those things. And one of my biggest complaints with that kind of methodology, and it's why I've just kind of scratched the surface is I've never been able to get a clear like definitive answer on okay well how many milligrams do I add? Because when it comes to bottles or other kind of nutrients we know what the nutrient load is of that material whereas when we ferment it's kind of a guessing game  There are ways that you can approximate it, but it's not the precision that my brain prefers to work in. However, unless you're extremely overdoing it, you're not necessarily going to cause negative effects that I'm aware of. So that kind of gives that buffer of suitability for some people, particularly if they don't have a huge budget to work with. So that's maybe where I would kind of go with that answer is just look at closing loops for neighbors, waste products, and then maybe, you know, grow your own crop of dandelions for nutrients, something to that effect. Yeah, K&F and G-M are great options. Absolutely. If you are on a budget, that's really what they're designed for. Yeah. Oh, and someone I see in the notes mentioned wood chips, that's a great carbon source, then you'd break down. You can look on chip drop for stuff like that. I get chips into my yard all the time. But yeah, you're gonna have to be a little creative. And. And I think getting, thinking about from like an element perspective, like where am I going to get my nitrogen? Where am I going to get my phosphorus? Where am I getting my potassium? We'll allow you to eventually, you know, or hopefully get everything you need to make a good growth. But yeah, that's a challenging budget, unfortunately. Yeah. And then, you, you know, I guess too, again, year after year, as you're able to add things to the soil, it should get better and hopefully less expensive year over year for you. So, oh, we got the major, he says, shovel, $5, buckets, $10. Yep, stuff does add up quickly. But again, a lot of this stuff sometimes is a one-time investment. And I see Dad, you put the link into here. I did. It's not posting on your channel, though. It says here, unfortunately, it says I'm able to post to Ed Westport, but that is the, that is the channel there for it. Okay well let's see if I can not copy paste from my side no if you put it in the private chat though I can copy it and I'll paste it into the chat for the people over on my channel watching right now thank you much I will copy it and get that in and let me go up to let me go back to the comments and get to our next question and again thank you for the question and I appreciate you tunin in for both weeks hope to continue to see you. Yeah there's some good good comments here and I just want to mention the comment section for folks too that answer the question as well so I appreciate that we're not we're not giving all the answers here. There's some new ones showing up in the comments section for people. That's what I love about both of our audiences is they're both very helpful and they're both knowledgeable and excited to learn more. So yeah chat is an awesome resource in and of itself and so that's why we turn to you guys for questions because you get the good ones and you know you stump us sometimes but that's the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the point the the the the the the the the the the the why we turn to you guys for questions, because you get the good ones and you know, you stump us sometimes, but that's the point, because we all get to kind of learn and grow together. Hey, Chad, I have a screaming child yelling my name right here. Give me one minute. I'm gonna mute myself. Why don't you take the next question? I will be right back. Absolutely. I will do that. Yeah, no problem. The next question that we have here in Minnesota High Life, thank you for tuning in. It says, what are good temps for growing auto flowers in an organic garden? I am going to go on a limb and actually say, just your normal temperature range. That's probably what you want to be growing at. I really don't see a big distinction between autoflowers and regulars. When it comes to environmental preferences, some strains will have, you know, some of the more equatorial strains. They will prefer a warmer, sunnier climate than something that's maybe grown in the, you know, Hindu mountains. So strain-wise, there may be a small preference, but they typically fit within the same window. A lot of us are growing multiple strains in the same location, so we kind of have to find that good window. Depending upon what your lighting is, you know, the old HPS systems, HID systems, you typically, 70s, mid-70s is getting a little bit of hot. It's really all about the leaf surface temperature though and the way that a HID light and an LED light affect leaf surface temperature are different. So with the LEDs, you do want to run your room a little bit hotter, the ambient temperature at least. Low 80s is typically where people have looked at that. And then again, about leaf surface temperature which helps with CO2 absorption, it helps with transpiration, which is nutrient uptake. But to answer the question in a quick way, the same, I would say same temperature. I don't think it's got a matter of an organic versus an inorganic grow as far as what the plant prefers. Unless you've heard anything differently, Dad, I'm unsure. I caught like half of that unfortunately, but it sounded like good to me. Yeah, sorry about that. No, no worries you were at the room. I didn't know if you had the earbuds in or not. But thank you for the question Minnesota. Hi Life. We will get that Let's see here One thing mentioned with temperature though It just really quickly is everyone should be using a VPD chart I can post one here in the chat for folks from Dr. Greenhouse And they actually has an app can download that makes it really easy, but knowing the relationship between temperature and humidity is really the key to having a healthy plant. So as your temperature changes, your humidity needs to change too. Yep, indeed. And again, that affects all of the things that I just mentioned as well. All right, so thank you. I will take that one off here. Yeah. I'll send it to you privately, Chad, because it's still not the page. That's a pussing on. There you go. All right, well, here's one that was specifically for you, though. It was as, let's talk about tad's fungal compost. My plants love it. plants love it. Okay. Yeah. Is it a specific kind of fungus or what do you got going on in there? So this dates back to when we were a compost tea business and only doing compost tea. Essentially people wanted more fungal content in their compost and so we were because everyone it's really easy to grow bacteria. So we named it that just because it does have fungal component in there but really what it is it's a combination of a few different compost that we then add like worm castings that we add some stuff to, like sometimes we'll add some unsulfurred mosses or alfalfa meal to feed the microbes and then let it sit and really grow. And then we send it out and people use it either to top dress with, it's kind of pricey. So I tend to tell people, you know, if you're gonna use it to make a compost tea to extract and replicate the microbes, and it becomes, you know, more affordable and that's the best way to use it, but you can also top dress with it too or something, but yeah, that's what we call our fungal compost. Cool, okay, and that's that's one that I haven't tried or been familiar with, so that's why I wanted to to to to to to to to Cool man and again the things that we put on our plants that were able to see these kind of like immediate results we can tell when plants love things. So that's always a good good sign in the garden. But back to you we kind of touched on this last week and this this could run into a question that maybe will take us through the rest the rest the rest the rest the rest the the the the the the the the the the the of the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of touched on this last week, and this could run into a question that maybe will take us through the rest of the episode, who knows here, but kind of pH. Brett J, though, he's wondering, he's like, how long does fine powder dolomite lime take to break down, adjust the soil pH? So from the moment you apply it, when does it start to work? And I'll even add another layer there. Does it take a while to get to the lower layers? Like changed, changed, changed, or is it universal? Yeah, it's complicated. So there's a few things there. Starting with, I like to incorporate amendments into the soil more fully, just so that they're more homogously spread through the rhizospher sphere. So a root, for example, a rootlet can reach out and access that nutrient at this depth and at this depth too. The biology is quite resilient. We're not tilling the soil with an actual mechanical tiller, so it's not as damaging to funnel communities and another microbiology would be if we were using an actual tilling machine outdoors agriculturally if we disturb the soil. So I don't mind a little soil disturbance. In terms of dolomite lime or any of these soil amendments, the main factors for availability are going to be based off of hydrology or your water moisture content. So that plays a huge role. The particle size, so you mentioned fine powder, that's going to have greater surface area, so that's going to allow it to be broken down faster than, say, granulated lymite lime or whatever product we're talking about. And then lastly, the biology of how biologically active your media is or your soil is going to play a big role too. Now, dolomite lime is probably my least favorite lime. Well, it is the least favorite type of lime. It's calcium, magnesium, carbonate. So the reason I don't like it as much is because when we formulate soils in general, the magnesium shows up. Usually from the compost and our other amendments, I don't typically have to add any magnesium amendments, things like, you know, K-meg, which is sole pomag, potash of sulfur magnesium, I think is the full name. Epsom salts, doomite, those are your main magnesium inputs. And I tend to not, whenever I formulate it, I don't add those at all, because I'm going to get a little bit from other things, like insect frats and other amendments that I'm adding into the mix. And if I see a magnesium deficiency, it's so easy to just add, you know, a tablespoon or a tablespoon per gallon of epsom salts and water that in and correct it really rapidly. But dolomite line is going to raise your pH very quickly. In terms of a timeline, I hesitate to really give one. What we will, what I can say is when we have like a low pH that we're trying to raise, I'll typically use something like walacinite or ag lime instead, which is just calcium carbonate or in the case ofestinite, calcium silicate. It's going to be slower at raising soil peach than dolomite, but by the end of the growth cycle, we will see the pH creeping up. So, you know, did it occur within the first couple of weeks or by the end of the cycle, I haven't t things enough to know and again it's going to vary in every environment. Soil temperature is going to play a role, pH is going to play a role in determining what microbes present to help break down these things. It's just very, very complicated. But as a general rule, we tend to want to do these things in between cycles and then see pH jump up over time. You could do you know runoff tests if in between with if you had like a combo meter to test or a pH pen to test to see if you are seeing the pH rise as a way of getting it closer to where you need to be if you're just way off before for a cycle starts. Is there good things to consider? And mainly kind of a big takeaway from that I think is it's not going to be immediate. It's not going to be, oh shoot, I have a problem, I'm going to put it on, and in two to three days the soil is going to be fine, we'll be back to smooth sailing. So it's not a quick fix, but it is something that you are monitoring over the course of the grow or during that down cycle to really see the reaction. Because like you said, there's a number of variables that will speed it up or impede its progress. Yeah, and the other thing I want to add is something that we forget about as growers is that the two things. So one, the pH of our soil always influx. It's never staying the same the same  know, I can't say my cell pH is 6.8. It's not, it's going to vary. Even though the pH is logarithmic, which means it's, you know, like the Richter scale. It's 10 times to the next point. So it's a dramatic, it's a pretty dramatic change. Your soil is fluctuating and your soil is not homogenous. So there are going to be little anaerobic pockets with lower pH in other places that we're going to have higher pH there. And so even if your overall soil pH, once you test it is not optimal. There's going to be places there where the plants can be able to thrive where some biology is still going to be able to do its thing. We want to move the pH into a range. I like, personally, I like 68 as a target. But if I'm 65 to 7, 3, 4, I'm probably just fine. Like it's going to be okay. Just as we stay within those ranges, it's easier for the plant to uptake nutrients. And if it's easier for the plant to take nutrients, it's going to grow faster, it's going to be happier. It's going to put more energy into the things that we want to rather than just trying to obtain nutrients. So, or are just  pH in the horizon here. So yeah, that's two thoughts on that. You know, that leads me into what I wanted to get into here. And it's, you know, here comes the bombshell chat. Get your opinions ready. Because there's, I've definitely heard both sides of this. And you have just mentioned too, when we're talking about pH There's a variety of areas to check pH a lot of times and in this case I'm talking about the pH of the water that you add But then that will be different than like well no in the question that I'm coming up you answered the last one excellent But so there's the pH the? the tho, the the the th, th. th. th. th. th. the the th. the the the the th. the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the th. th. the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. th. the the the the the the the the the th. th. the the th. th. the the th. the th. the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the th. th. the th. there's the pH to the water that you add, which is going to be different than the soil pH, which is going to be different than the pH around the root zone in the rhizospher, because microbes, they can affect the pH. They will change the pH in that close. And here's the bombshell. P-haging in organic systems with organic soils. From how I understand it, that the microbial life, the soil biology, does add a bit of buffering to the soil. So you can add in something that's maybe a little higher or lower and it will bring it to that happy medium to exactly where the plants want it. That is the answer that I've gotten. The majority of organic bed growers I know don't bother with pHing, but I still always do it out of habit because my example is like what if your water is just so far out of whack? You've never checked it so you don't really know. Over time I would think that compounds, like can't you wear out those particular microbes that may skew it towards your favor or would that possibly, you know, accelerate the growth of a different sort of microbe that's not as beneficial to the root zone? So I personally say say always pH your water no matter what system you're in. But what is your opinion and do you have more data than to back that up? Yeah, so I'm saying always. I talk about it's a fair bit and it's funny. so when I do an interview with like an agronomist or soil scientist or someone who were a consultant that works on scale in organic systems, they always kind of look at me funny when I ask them the question because to that's not even a question. They absolutely will look at pH does matter in organic soils. It's sort of the consensus. Now, does your water have to be pHed every single time? Probably not. And your water probably doesn't play as it doesn't play as much of a role as the media does in terms of determining rhizosphere pH. But if  we, and really when people talk about water, what we need to be talking about is not the pH of the water, but the alkalinity of that water, like the ability, like how much do we need to add to buff the water to change that pH level. So if the alkalinity is low, like in like RO water, our PPM, that water is, you know, five or 10 or 15 and the pH is eight, that's fine. That water is perfectly okay to use in terms of a pH because I don't need a pH. I might want to buffer it by adding some more nutrients into it, but in terms of the pH level, it's not a role. But if that pH is, or if alkalinity is quite high, the ability to move the pH of the water is much harder, which means it has a lot more nutrients fertility in it, and that could be sodium, it could be chloride, it could be a number of things that we may not want, or it could be calcium and magnesium, but we still want to count for it. In terms of the soil itself though, yes, pH does play an important role. pH can vary, there can be different pH pockets in your soil. And the reason I think most people get away with this is because when we start with something like peat moss, that's a very low pH. And we add compost, which has a higher pH traditionally. And then we had all these different nutrients in there. We tend to just kind of naturally end up within that range. And that's why people say you can throw all your pH pen. In general, most people have good water. So we can throw out a pH pen. But if we want to optimize plant health, and if you're going to spend all these money on all these different products and all these different amendments, you sure as hell should be pH in your water and knowing the pH of your soil, because that to me is way more important than any of these enzyme and microbes and all these other things you could spend money on. Here's something that you can just optimize in your garden for very, you know, for pennies that's going to have a big role in your plant. And that could turn out to be the limiting factor. You know, like you said, you can have all this soil microbial activity. You could have, you know, the best soil, but if the pH isn't in the right zone, that's going to be your limiting factor and the plant's not going to be able to perform to its fullest potential. And you're right, my water, my tap water comes out at like 7.0 and about 30 ppm. So if anything maybe add a little calcium into it, call it good, I could almost never look at my pH and be fine. That's how some people do get away with it. Like there is no problem. But I also have a friend who dug a well and their water was just so far out of what you would want to put on a plant that they, you know, had to react to it. And the lack of nutrients in the water, so the lower the PPM, the more, the easier it would be to swing, whereas if there's nutrients or a higher PPM just out of the tap regardless of what it is, that's going to be the stuff the stuff the stuff the stuff  that maybe would make soil life work a little bit harder I see Cav snake oil near is it my PPM is 480. Yeah, that's that's a lot. It's good to know what's creating that you know that level  And, you know, I'm not a water expert. This is just what I've learned from talking to a lot of people about water. And Brandon, who actually works for KISS on a blog page, put together a paper on understanding a water analysis metric. So you can go in there and look and see if your water is okay for growing or not, or if you may want to filter it or adjust it. But yeah, so it's a still contentious topic, but I think it's important. And thank you for helping me with that one. Because again, I always like to try to err on the side of caution. If it's not something that is, you know, beneficial to everybody, but it's not going to hurt you, maybe there is some benefit. Because again, most of the answers with any of this is it depends. There's always going to be variables. So that's it. So when I look at a soil test, the first thing I look at on that test, go straight to the, if I have a Logan complete test, which will be a standard test and a saturated paste, so one's a really strong acid extraction, which is the Malik 3 test, that's your standard test, and then the other one is a saturated paste test, which is just a test with water, what comes out in water. So the first thing I look at is that pH number. And then I look at what's creating that. So if my pH is really, really low, that tells me I probably have a lot of anion in that soil. And sometimes I'm going to be like, oh, sure enough, I have 300 p.m. of nitrates. And that's why my pH is 55. Well, shit, that's too much nitrates for a plant. I'm going to see, most likely see some nitrogen toxicities. I need to flush this soil. And by flushing the soil, I'm going to remove nitrate. And I'm going to raise the pH pH backup into a range that's better for the plant anyway. So pH is a relationship between fertility and and so it's important to think about it in the sense of like what's creating it. What what anion and cations, you know, negative and positive charges are creating this number. So that's that's how I approach it I guess. Finding out the why is always something I encourage. Why is it this way? And then that can lead to the root answer. I think that's a good place to good place to kind of end it for this week. All right. We've got we've got a couple questions. I've got a couple questions starting here and actually I'll do one more because it's it's almost spring here and see got this in at the very beginning of the show. Trippy Grows I got your cover crop questions we will cover that on a future episode because that one we will go in depth on or we can go in depth on it. That's a great subject. Gateway to the garden. I see it in here, Cheddar Bob. Thanks for tuning in, man. We'll get to some worms, protozoas, and nematodes in a future episode. But let me get to see his question here real quick before we start out because it is spring and it is almost time to start thinking about putting things outside. Although we just just just just just just just just just just just just just walk on the beach yesterday while it was snowing. That's always an interesting one. But C. Says do you recommend cold frames or later starts for another method to keep sprouts going with large temperature swings, winter frost hitting in March. Yes, so starting indoors and then bringing outdoors or a cold frame. Oh, are you asking me? I guess so. I kind of ended that on a cliff hanger there. Okay, yeah, I assume we're talking about cannabis or vegetables or... Let's go for... Let's just go for... Well, plants. Vegetables. I would say start your cannabis inside if you can and just baby those. But vegetables. I know a lot of us are into that gardening as well. And that's a... It's a good time of year. I'm starting to look at my beds. Again, I got the Holland Bold Company open on the other page right now. So, yeah. Well, it really depends on the plant. Like, I put my garlic in a couple months ago, but everything else I'm really waiting on. It's hard to, like, Delia's waiting probably till like April, May, in April early May, potatoes is left to wait on. Cannabis especially, and one thing interesting enough, because I always associate cannabis with tomatoes. So here in northern the northwest, western Washington, we typically say Mother Day is the time to put out your tomatoes, because  puts you past that that gives your soil temperature up. So the biggest variable in plant survival or is really your I'm not saying this well but it's really your soil temperature more so than your ambient air temperature and that soil is really cold right now as much as like right now it's it's not bad it's probably probably like 55 outside. I can go outside. It's sunny but my plants to be miserable. So I would say just wait as long as possible. People you're better off having a plant started later. And I see this with tomatoes all the time. I'll get my tomatoes. I'll get my tomatoes out and then we'll have a cold night. They'll freeze or something, and then the plants just stunt or die. But if I those tomatoes I started two weeks later that I didn't put out, actually, and outgrowing, out yielding the ones that I stressed out. So it's always better, I think, to wait more than you, it's not intuitive, but in my experience it works out a lot better. And you touched on the reason that I wanted to bring up to, and this person does as well, you know, soil temperature. My first thought was like, you know, are they in pots? Are they in the ground? It's still going to be probably a little bit cold for both, depending upon your crop. You mentioned garlic. I know garlic typically goes in the ground in September so it can overwinter. But there's a lot of things that you can do if you wanted to get things in the ground. Again, it really depends on the scale that you want to do things at and the level of commitment. I know a lot of strawberry farmers will, you know, they will mound their soil, they will cover it with plastic, they will help kind of keep that thermal heat in there. So you can go that far if you wanted to get a really big jump on it, but again, that boils back down to the soil temperatures. And like Tad was saying, too, is you know, sometimes just waiting a little bit longer to go through less stress will be the right answer. It's not always the duration. Consult your farmer's almanac, stick your finger in the air and then test it out. I want, there's two things to keep in mind. One, your grocery store is always going to thought your tomato starts, two weeks to a month, too early. And they coming back and rebuying them after they die. I swear to you I know this I own a garden center. And then the other thing is know your gardening zone. So we're talking about you know the northwest here where we both live in Western Washington but where you live you know after watching this may be totally different but knowing what your climate is and what your gardening zone is. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the to the to the to to to to the the the the to to to to th the thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi thi their their their their their their their their their their their their their their th th th th  you know, after watching this may be totally different. But knowing what your climate is, what your gardening zone is, you can, once you know your garden zone, you can type that in and you can tell you when to start different crops. And you could probably treat cannabis like tomatoes in terms of hardiness and when you can move them outside. Nice. And we, I know they the USDA or gosh whoever runs that they just updated the Hardiness zones I think we went from like 9b or 9a I think we're one of those. Yeah yeah they did just change it recently. Yeah due to climate change. Yeah and then and that's what I'm looking at too again I said that I've got the Holland Bulb Company open on the other page and the one plan I'm looking at right now, it's zone 8 to 11. It's just freaking awesome. Oh, there you got. Yeah, you can grow it. Redemption pre-potted elephant here. It's a psychedelic looking plan. It's pretty freaking cool. I blame Instagram for that fine. But I'm going to buy it. I'm going to to plan a a the the get that out there into the soil. So maybe now is a good time to start applying your amendments. Start getting that soil ready before you plan into it. Give it a little bit of time to work its way in there. And yeah, let the worms do their action. I swear I'll get to your worm question, JedderBob. We'll get to that next time. And and G's Death Wish again is mulching, landscaping fabrics, wood chips we mentioned earlier. Those are also ways you can kind of keep some temperature in the soil, but we're droning on. I appreciate everybody tuning in, Tad. You've got the soil summit coming up this weekend. Do you want to tell people one more time where they can attend that or find more information? Well, it starts on Thursday, so it's a little late for people probably to get tickets unless you live in Peruf, Nevada. I think they are. If you buy a ticket, though, I think they are going to release the videos from it. But if you're curious about at least what we're presenting on, I plan on publishing all those on YouTube after. I'll record them separately and then publish them. But yeah, you can go to grassroots beds or grassroots pots. I can't remember their website exactly. But if you go on there, you can read about it and see who's going to be at the event. There's a lot of names people will recognize and it should be a lot of fun. Yeah. Awesome. Well, I hope you enjoy your time. I know personally, more than a handful of people that will be there and that doesn't even count you. So yeah, it'll be a lot of good times, a lot of fun people, a lot of smart people. So it'd be a great place to be. I look forward to watching those videos. And yeah, if anybody out there in the chats want to stay in toucest with us, both of the Instagrams, both of the YouTubes are down in the show notes. So hit them up. Yeah, and post questions for next week and conversation topics. And then, and then,to answer the questions to show up on our YouTube page or if you tag me I'll do my best. But yeah, thanks Chad, this was fun. Yep, my pleasure. Thank you again for connecting with me for the sake of everybody's entertainment and knowledge. Guys leave comments down below and we will take a look and get them on the next show. That rhymed so here we go.
