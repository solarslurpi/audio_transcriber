# Organic Gardening Q&A Episode 5 with Tad Hussey & Chad Westport Summary

## Introduction
This episode of Organic Gardening Q&A, featuring Tad Hussey and Chad Westport, discusses the selection and use of organic inputs. Amid challenges, such as power outages, the hosts cover the safety, sustainability, and environmental implications of various organic inputs, including animal-based and ocean-sourced products, as well as mined materials. The conversation also examines the reliability of organic certifications and provides advice for growers on managing heavy metal contamination and ecological footprints.

## Key Topics Discussed

### The Safety of Organic Inputs
The potential contamination of products like blood meal, bone meal, and feather meal is discussed, highlighting concerns about GMOs, antibiotics, pesticides, and heavy metals due to industrial practices. Despite fears, evidence suggests these concerns might not significantly affect crop contamination.

> "The argument is that these inputs...could be contaminated...But the real issue is, are these things contaminating your crop?"

### Environmental and Ecological Considerations
The conversation addresses environmental concerns associated with fish-based products, such as fish bone meal and kelp, emphasizing the ecological footprint of the fishing industry and bycatch issues. The significant use of fossil fuels in fishing and processing is critiqued.

> "The amount of fossil fuels that go into fishing is massive...So if we want to talk about what's bad for the environment...is massive."

### Certification and Regulation
The effectiveness and reliability of organic certifications, such as OMRI, are critiqued, suggesting that certifications might not always guarantee safety or sustainability.

> "But if the certification doesn't have intrinsic value, then what's it really worth?"

### Practical Advice for Growers
Tad Hussey offers specific advice for reducing heavy metal accumulation in crops, focusing on soil pH management, silica usage, and the importance of removing roots and leaves to minimize contamination.

> "Keeping higher levels of silica in your soil...because if the plant has sufficient silica, that will actually help in reducing the amount of arsenic uptake."

### Research and Information Gaps
The need for more research on the impact and safety of various organic inputs is acknowledged, highlighting the lack of comprehensive and accessible information for growers.

> "Unfortunately, there's just not a lot of good information out there. The research hasn't been done."
