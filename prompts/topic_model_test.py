We are live. I'm here with Mason again this week. Hey, how are you doing? Doing all right. It's a crazy time of year on my farm, so it's busy. Yeah, I just realized I should have started my tomatoes and some of my plants already, and I'm running behind now, so I'm scrambling. And I'm also building raised beds, which is kind of a nice little rabbit hole. I don't know if you've gone down that all because you only work on scale. Have you looked into like safe affordable raised beds? Total, so you know, you know that before I was farming and consulting, I had a raised bed company, I installed like 3,000 raised beds. So yeah, I know raised beds in and out. So let's, you know, while we're waiting for some questions to pop up and people to join, let's talk about that because I did it went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how, what's the most affordable way to build a raised bed? Because my soul is full of arsenic, so I can't grow in it. That's cheap. And going to last a decent amount of time. I realize nothing really lasts forever. What's going to last, what's my best bang for my buck there in your opinion? I mean, in my opinion, let me just say, there are less expensive options than this, but I can explain why I think it's the best, which is untreated cedar or redwood. I did, I would get rough cut, two by six cedar. And that's what I would make the beds out of with four by four posts in the corners. And then a four by four post. If we went, I like to go 18 inches to 24 inches tall for ease of use and a little bar of root space, especially if you can't dive into the subsoil. And in that case, you want to put 4 by 4x4 post midway through the 4 by 8 bed. And I would just go 100% cedar. So you can go cheaper, let's just say like home depot, 2x4s. But those things really don't last like more than a couple years if it's not treated. You could go treated treated lumber and gardening even though you know theoretically the industry says it's safe I don't I don't go that route. Yeah. You'd go real cheap with cinder blocks or plywood but aesthetically, it's like, man. Oh, I would not mess with cinder blocks after reading about the mixes, the lies, and that they used to hold it all together. It sounds like there can be a lot of contamination there, because they're not designed to be around edible crops. I know people do it, but when I started reading about it, I got nervous. They also get super hot and they look like they look in garbage. So I mean, yeah, I'm in the, what did you land on? I'm curious. So I wanted to do the rough-hewn cedar, but it's just too expensive because I have a pretty large garden that I'm installing. I mean, we're talking like 10 4x4 beds, another like 8 4 by 8 beds plus some other weirdly designed shaped beds. So it's a huge garden. So what I landed on, and I don't know if this is going to work, but I'm doing it, is just a cheap fur or pine from Home Depot, two by sixes. I'm putting two two by sixes together and then shoot. I'm gonna, this is awful. I'm Japanese and I can't pronounce it. Shashugi-Bahn. Is that how you say it? I have to look it up to make sure I get the right. So we did Shashugibon on our entire house, exterior of our house. So we burnt, I mean for people who don't know, we burnt it, treating a, it's like it creates a pitch black exterior that preserves wood. I call it Shashugibon, but as I'm not, you know, I'm sure that's wrong, but I looked at it. I would pronounce the show show show show show show show you bond is sort of how I would read it, but again, this is like without seeing the Japanese characters and assuming I can even read them. This is my Japanese is. Yeah. That's how I pronounce it. Yeah. So, okay, cool. That's a great idea. So I'm doing that. And  I'm putting pure tongue oil over the top of that. Hoping that that will preserve it longer than just, sorry I'm reading Richard's comment. Yes, I'm half Japanese, I'm so sorry, I'm half Japanese, I'm so sorry I took like seven years of Japanese and I don't remember all of it anymore, unfortunately. But yeah, so I'm hoping though this will preserve the quality of the wood a lot better. That's a great idea. It's super creative. It'll surely help. My only suggestion on Shishibon is blast it longer than you think because a lot of that black exterior washes off. So really burn it, burn it like you know really torch that thing. So I already did a bunch and oiled them and realized I didn't do them enough. They look beautiful like with the oil. Yeah, brings out the grain and everything. Oh, it's incredible looking. You would be, it looks, but I don't think they're going to last. But now I have an experiment. So I'm actually doing an A, B test. I have the ones that I didn't char enough and I sanded too's see here. I'm gonna I'm gonna scroll back through and people post questions as we go here. Where this is gonna be a purely a Q&A conversation today. And if you do get a chance, please do hit the like button as well if you're watching it because it does help bring in more people to the conversation to find out about it. And then also make sure to follow Bryant because he's putting up content that's separate from what I'm putting out and vice versa. So if you give us both a follow, really appreciate it. All right. Questions, Jim Trim asked, is oat holes a good replacement for rice holes or perlite? I've never used them. I'm looking them up right now. I don't even know what they look like. Okay. I think, you know, I can't even find a good, I have to spell it right. That's what I'm going to. I bet you it's a great replacement. I think they would, they might break down a little faster. I think, you know, you get the advantage of not having as much arsenic input from the rice holes. They might be a little larger. I think with any input like that where there's not like rules of thumb, you just got to experiment. Try different percentages, use your intuition, water it before you do a big mix, do a test batch and see how quickly it drains, stuff like that. That's my thought. Yeah, my experience with rice holes was they caused issues with drainage and so I found they broke down too quickly in a biologically active soil. So, and you mentioned the risk of arsenic. I agree with everything you said. I would say if you are going to use them, I would not use them as your primary form of aeration in your mix. Let's just say as a rough number to say less than 10% of your total aeration. Yeah. And then just monitor the physical properties. Exactly. But I'm all for, like if you have a local source, if that's like your local organic matter slash aggregate, then by all means do it. Try it, I should say. Yeah, I wouldn't be paying to ship it to you if you if you don't have it. But great question. All right, we're going to jump around today. Brian, how do you feel about oak from Palatwood? As long as it's not treated, painted, stained, doesn't look like give any weird things on it. I think it'd be awesome. And I'm assuming he's talking about the raised bed conversation we're talking about. Yeah, I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I th. Yeah. I th. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm assuming he's talking about the raised bed conversation we're talking about. Yeah. I mean, again, like, you know, if you've got the resource, you know, Palawood is probably like less, it's like one by. So it's gonna be a little flimsier. You're gonna have to reinforce it more with two by force on the inside. But if you got it, and you want to pull it apart, it's not too messed up and not treated, then by all means, I think that's great. It's a hard wood. Yeah, I would agree, it's just going to be really thin, so whatever you do is not going to last as long as you may want it to, but it's free. It's a lot of labor taking apart palates too with nails and stuff. It can be a real pain. It might not not be worth your time, but if you have them, use them. Someone mentions hydrifiber. Carly mentions that they could replace pearlite with hydrifiber. Do you have any experience with that as a substrate? I've worked with growers who have used it, but I have personally not used it. I can't remember what the feedback was. Again, I think the takeaway from someone who was doing a lot of soil mix is, I think, in the UK, because in the UK, they're trying to replace peat moss entirely.
