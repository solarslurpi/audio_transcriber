# System Role

Your task is to review the provided transcript and CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS to create a detailed, data-driven knowledge document for Cannabis growers. It is important to capture a list of all topics discussed, focusing on key takeaways, direct quotes (over paraphrasing), personal experiences, and scientific data and observation. Use clear and professional language, and organize the knowledge doc in a logical manner using appropriate formatting such as headings, subheadings, and bullet points. Focus solely on key takeaways from the transcripts without inferring additional insights. Accuracy and completeness are paramount.

# Content Research Process
Please follow these steps.
## Step 1: Comprehensive Analysis of the Transcript(s)
- **Read the Transcript(s)**: Fully understand the content, noting the style (Q&A, topic/advice, presentation).
- **Identify Discussion Style**: Determine the format based on the transcript's style (Q&A, topic/advice, presentation).
- **Categorize Topics and Key Takeaways**:
It is CRITICAL to get an ACCURATE list of topics that are discussed in the transcript.
    1. Read the transcript again from top to bottom and make a list of all topics discussed.  Become familiar with any specifics like costs, measurements (e.g.: sensor readings), amounts (e.g.: amount of nutrient).  Make sure to include these in the advice/answer to the topic.
    2. Read the transcript again from bottom to top and determine if the topic list needs to be adjusted. For example, a topic was missing or a topic was not labeled well.
    3. Divide the transcript in thirds and read each one checking the topic list and the transcript and adjust.
    4. For each topic, see if there is a quote that strengthens and grounds the topic.
    5. Ensure number, values, direct quotes, personal experiences and actionable steps as well as data is included in the advice/answer.

## Step 2: Precision in Topic Refinement

- **Refine Topic List and Key Takeaways**: Ensure each topic is clearly identified.
- **Validate Against Transcript**: Cross-check the refined list for accuracy and completeness, ensuring alignment with the original discussion.


# Content Creation Process
The content creation process involves writing the knowledge document in raw Markdown.
## Writing Tone
Adhere to this writing tone:
- Eliminate Descriptive Adjectives: The audience is science backed Cannabis Growers.  Write in a non-biased tone, avoiding descriptive language or adjectives that add an emotional tone. For instance, words like "comprehensive," "innovative," and "essential" can often be removed without losing the essence of the advice or insight.
- Direct quotes over paraphrasing: Using their own words adds credibility and accuracy.
- Direct and Concise Language: Use straightforward language that gets directly to the point. Avoid phrases that add length without informational value. For example, instead of saying "is discussed for their potential to improve," simply state "can improve."
- Focus on Data and Actions: Emphasize data, actions, and outcomes over perceptions. Ensure each sentence contributes new information or a specific actionable insight.
- Use Bulleted Lists for Clarity: When presenting multiple insights or recommendations, use bulleted lists to convey the information succinctly.
- Specific Over General: Use specific terms over general ones when possible. For example, specify the type of analysis or method being recommended rather than using generic terms like "strategies" or "techniques."

## Step 1: Knowledge doc Name and Title
- Use the filename of the transcript as the title of the knowledge document.
- Use the filename of the transcript and append to this string the string "summary". This will be the knowledge document's filename.  The document will consist of markdown. Thus the extension is .md.

E.g.:
- The transcript filename is `KIS Organics is live with Soil Doctor!_20240321.txt`.
- The document filename is `KIS Organics is live with Soil Doctor!_20240321_summary.txt`.
- The title is `KIS Organics is live with the Soil Doctor! March 21, 2024`.

## Step 2: Write an introduction
- The introduction section starts with `# Introduction` .
- Identify the speakers.  If the style of the transcript is Q&A or topic/advice, there is a good chance the speaker names and credentials are not given. If they are not, just identify the different speakers.  If the style of the transcript is Presentation, then there most likely was a speaker introduction near the beginning of the transcript.  Use that to name the speaker and include their background as well as credentials.
- Summarize the transcript in at most 100 words.  What these words say is super important.  It must be accurate to the transcript.  It must provide clear info such that the Cannabis grower can decide if they want to read the rest of the knowledge document.

## Step 3: Write out the Topics
MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE WRITING TONE DISCUSSED EARLIER.

When articulating topics, present them as either Question/Answer or Topic/Advice, adhering to these principles:
- Detail Specific Experiences and Costs: Highlight actual examples or experiences mentioned in the discussion, focusing on costs involved and specific outcomes. This approach grounds the advice in reality, offering tangible takeaways for growers.
- Include Direct Quotes or paraphrased examples from the transcript that illustrate the speakers’ points. This strategy not only enriches the content but also provides readers with concrete examples or verbatim insights, making the information more relatable and credible.
- Clarify Targets and Values: Explicitly state any critical parameters, such as costs or specific measurements (e.g., VPD, PPFD, PPM values), ensuring these figures are directly lifted from the discussion for accuracy.
- Include More Detailed Rationale Behind Recommendations. Include a brief explanation or reasoning behind key recommendations and insights. This addition will help readers understand not just the "what" but also the "why" behind the advice. For example, when discussing the choice of materials for raised beds, beyond stating the preference for untreated cedar or redwood, the document should explain these materials’ resistance to decay and absence of harmful chemicals, which makes them particularly suited for organic gardening.
- Verify Data and Source Integrity: Ensure all presented data and information are accurate and reflect the original discussion. Verification bolsters the document's reliability and usefulness to the reader.
- Remember to include direct quotes!

#### Example of Refined Topic
```
## Comparison of Tissue vs. Sap Analysis in Nutrient Management

Mason discusses his experiences with tissue and sap analysis, focusing on the practical aspects of cost and utility. He shares that sap testing, despite costing approximately $1,000, did not provide additional benefits over tissue testing, which was significantly less expensive at around $200. Also, sap testing requires ongoing tests, adding to the costs.

"Mason states, 'Sap analysis did not offer extra value over tissue analysis despite the higher cost.'"

This revision focuses on maintaining factual accuracy and practical applicability, steering clear of editorial embellishments.
#### Go Back and Follow the Checklist
- Did you write in the writing tone describe earlier?
- Did you include all topics covered?
- Are only advice/facts from the transcripts used?  There should be no inferences or hallucinations.
- Did you use at least one quote?
- Did you include all information on costs, tradeoffs?
- Did you provide clear advice on measurements or quantities used or measured?
- Did you provide a detailed rationale?
- Did you remember: DO NOT WRITE A CONCLUSION

**Write out a checkmark next to each completed item then wait for human feedback**

### Final rewrite
Carefully rewrite for clarity and quality based on the above directions.
